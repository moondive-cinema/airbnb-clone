# Airbnb Clone

Cloning Airbnb with Python(3.8), Django(2.2.5), Tailwind and more.

## Issues to be fixed

- Home search form input(city) leads us default search form with returning city as initial value "Anywhere"

- Email verification was not succeeded as mailgun didn't work. I should try with gmail account later.

- In sign-up form, once I get an error rendering in email field with unsuitable value(i.e invalid email address), even though the value is put with appropriate format and then push the submit button, the error rendering remains unchanged.
