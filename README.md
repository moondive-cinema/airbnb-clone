# Airbnb Clone

Cloning Airbnb with Python(3.8), Django(2.2.5), Tailwind and more.

## Issues to be fixed

- Home search form input(city) leads us default search form with returning city as initial value "Anywhere"

- Email verification was not succeeded as mailgun didn't work. I should try with gmail account later.

- In sign-up form, once I get an error rendering in email field with unsuitable value(i.e invalid email address), even though the value is put with appropriate format and then push the submit button, the error rendering remains unchanged.

- Negative margin applied in the main page. It leads overflow at both sides when the screen is narrow. Should be fixed later.

- User profile edit cannot show the text inside the form only when it's run by Chrome.

- styles.scss의 btn-link에 다른 스타일을 적용하려고 하면 적용되지 않음
